# RSKtools

Current stable version: 3.5.3 (2021-09-22)

RSKtools is a Matlab toolbox designed to help RBR users work with the
"RSK" SQLite data files generated by RBR instruments. This repository
is for the development version of the toolbox -- for the current
stable version go to:

[http://www.rbr-global.com/support/matlab-tools](http://www.rbr-global.com/support/matlab-tools)

Please note, RSKtools requires MATLAB R2013b or later, and we
recommend installing the freely
available [TEOS-10 GSW](http://www.teos-10.org/software.htm)
and
[cmocean](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/57773-cmocean-perceptually-uniform-colormaps) packages.


## What can RSKtools do?

* Open RSK files:
```matlab
rsk = RSKopen('sample.rsk');
```

* Print instrument information and a list of data channels:
```matlab
RSKprintchannels(rsk)
```

* Read data from RSK files:
```matlab
rsk = RSKreaddata(rsk);
```

* Plot a time series of the data:
```matlab
RSKplotdata(rsk);
```

* Low-pass filter selected channels:
```matlab
rsk = RSKsmooth(rsk,'channel',{'Conductivity','Temperature'},'windowLength',5);
```

* And lots of other stuff like automatic profile detection, sensor time
  alignment, bin averaging, and exporting data to CSV files.

## How do I get set up?

* Unzip the archive (to `~/matlab/RSKtools`, for instance).
* Add the RSKtools folder to your Matlab path by running either of the following at the command prompt:
    * `addpath ~/matlab/RSKtools`
    * `pathtool` and manually add RSKtools directory
* Type `help RSKtools` to get an overview and take a look at the examples.
* Read the [RSKtools User Manual](https://docs.rbr-global.com/rsktools).
* Check out [Getting started](https://rbr-global.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Getting_Started.pdf)
  and [Post-processing](https://rbr-global.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/PostProcessing.pdf) for a quick start.

## A note on calculation of salinity

A typical RBR CTD (e.g., Concerto or Maestro) has sensors to measure
*in situ* pressure, temperature, and electrical conductivity. These
three variables are required to calculate seawater salinity, either
using the Practical Salinity Scale (PSS-78,
see
[Unesco, 1981](http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0004/000461/046148eb.pdf)),
or Absolute Salinity based on the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater
2010 (see [IOC, SCOR and IAPSO, 2010](http://www.teos-10.org)).  If
the [TEOS-10 GSW](http://www.teos-10.org/software.htm) or [seawater]
(http://www.cmar.csiro.au/datacentre/ext_docs/seawater.htm) Matlab 
toolbox is installed, users can call the `RSKtools` function
`RSKderivesalinity` to calculate Practical Salinity and store it as a 
channel in the RSK structure.
