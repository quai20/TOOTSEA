## Summary
TOOTSEA (Toolbox for Time Series Exploration and Analysis) is a Matlab solftware, developped at LOPS (Laboratoire d'Oc√©anographie Physique et Spatiale), IFREMER. This tool is dedicated to analysing datasets from moored oceanographic instruments (Currentmeter, CTD, Thermistance, ...). TOOTSEA allows the user to explore the data and metadata from various instruments file, to analyse them with multiple plots and stats available, to do some processing/corrections and qualify (automatically and manually) the data, and finally to export the work in a netcdf file.  
Find web documentation [here](https://quai20.github.io/TOOTSEA/).

Some work plan :
* [X] Some code review before release (on going)
* [X] [Web documentation](https://quai20.github.io/TOOTSEA/) 
* [X] Some unit testing in tests/ (to be continued, with GUIDE test if possible)
* [X] Some tiny example datasets to be used in the tests
* [X] Contribution guidelines  
* [X] Release

## Testing
You can test some basic behaviours of Tootsea by running `run_tests`, which runs every `test_xxx.m` test file present in the `tests` directory. If you want to contribute to the code, please consider adding your tests there.  
Since `TOOTSEA` is UI based, some behaviors are tricky to test automatically, for those, you can find some testing protocols in [tests/testing_protocols.md](tests/testing_protocols.md).
